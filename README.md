# ICAR-Computer-Vision-Intern
This repository contains all my work that I did in my winter intern at ICAR-CIFE which was entirely based on computer vision. During this internship I trained YOLOv8 model on custom datasets of Fishes and Shrimps.
Based on my trained model I was able to count the no of fishes and shrimps in an aquarium with an accuragy of about 85%.
On top of the YOLO model I applied "DeepSORT" model for tracking of each shrimps, to predict their behaviours based on Gasping, Resting, Erratic and Unbalanced motion.
For the length estimation I used Aruco markers for pixel-to-cm conversion ans currently working on stereo vision to calculate the distance of each fishes/shrimps from the camera so to estimate their length accurately.
